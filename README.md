# ASL-Digit Recognition

American Sign Language Digit Recognition using CNN

## Project Overview

This project is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) Digit Recognition system developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV.

The system captures hand gestures through a webcam, processes the hand region using image preprocessing techniques, and predicts ASL digits (0–9) in real time.

## Features

* Real-time webcam prediction
* ASL digit recognition (0–9)
* CNN-based deep learning model
* Image preprocessing using OpenCV
* Thresholding for hand segmentation
* Live prediction display with confidence score

## Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
